## Project Overview
Welcome to The-Fundsfinder_Gram_ATM-Machine Simulator, a project born out of curiosity and creativity! Inspired by the idea of making ATM interactions feel intuitive and secure, this simulator allows users to check their balance, deposit or withdraw money, and even change their PIN all in a simulated environment.

The project was built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure the code stays clean, organized, and easy to manage. It all starts with classes that act as the backbone of the simulator, keeping track of user data and actions. Instance variables hold personal details like balances and PINs, while methods handle actions like deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

To make things smarter, class methods and static methods step in to manage shared tasks, such as validating inputs or keeping track of login attempts. For flexibility, inheritance allows the code to expand easily for instance, adding different user types. Magic methods add a touch of personality, deciding how objects are displayed, while property decorators make balance checks seamless and secure.

This simulator isn’t just about code—it’s about creating a simple yet exciting experience. From concept to execution, it’s a blend of practicality and fun, and I’m thrilled to share it with you!
